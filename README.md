# Code Samples
Hello! Welcome to our little code samples cheat sheet. 

This is just a small thing done by [Arash](https://github.com/arashnrim) and [JX](https://github.com/pikanotjx). 

## What you can find here!
Currently have code samples for C# and Python. As we are doing this alongside our progress in school, this cheat sheet is nowhere near complete. 

## Contributing
This project is accepting contributions! If you'd like to contribute to have a go at creating more code samples for any of the language we've already done, or perhaps even creating code samples for another programming language, by all means! We welcome your involvment. 

If there is an issue, such as spelling or grammatical error, or even an error in the code itself, please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/arashnrim/code-samples/issues/new). If you would like to leave comments about the code sample — like other possible ways to write the code and code improvements, or other kinds of feedback — please feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/arashnrim/code-samples/issues/new) too if you wish!

## Good luck!
We hope that this code sample has maybe helped you solve a bug, recall something you forgotten, or even helped you in your last minute study grind before your test/exams *cough*. Whatever it is, have fun and good luck!
